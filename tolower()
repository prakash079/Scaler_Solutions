Problem Description
You are given a function to_lower() which takes a character array A as an argument.

Convert each character of A into lowercase characters if it exists. If the lowercase of a character does not exist, it remains unmodified.
The uppercase letters from A to Z are converted to lowercase letters from a to z respectively.

Return the lowercase version of the given character array.

Solution - 

vector<char> Solution::to_lower(vector<char> &A) {
    int n= A.size();
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(A[i]<='Z' && A[i]>='A')
            A[i]+=32;
    }
    return A;
}
